# Case Studies

Real projects, real results. Here are some examples of how I've helped clients solve complex problems and achieve significant cost savings.

## 1. Legacy Rails App Recovery (Heroku Slug Rebuild)

**Challenge:** Client had no source code, only an app running on Heroku.

**Solution:** Reconstructed the entire Rails application from the slug, upgraded dependencies, fixed bugs, and restored the system.

**Impact:**
- ✅ App fully restored
- ✅ Saved the client from a costly rebuild
- ✅ Modernized code and infrastructure

**Technologies Used:** Ruby on Rails, Heroku, PostgreSQL

## 2. Deep Cleaning Operations Platform (UK Client)

**Challenge:** A large cleaning company needed scheduling, staff management, job tracking, and a mobile staff portal.

**Solution:** Built comprehensive operations platform with:

- Mobile staff login
- Time tracking + GPS logging
- Payroll automation
- Multi-location job management
- Vehicle/mobile unit scheduling

**Impact:**
- ✅ Automated operations
- ✅ Reduced admin time
- ✅ Eliminated manual paperwork

**Technologies Used:** Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Mobile API, GPS Integration

## 3. WooCommerce → Rails → Xero Integration

**Challenge:** Client needed automated accounting workflow from e-commerce orders.

**Solution:** Built Rails system that imports WooCommerce orders, links books via ISBN, and auto-generates invoices in Xero.

**Impact:**

## 4. Cloud Migration (Google Cloud → Hetzner)

**Challenge:** Client was spending $30,000/month on Google Cloud with inefficient infrastructure scaling.

**Solution:** Migrated infrastructure to Hetzner dedicated VPS, optimized server sizing, and implemented efficient scaling.

**Impact:**
- ✅ **10x cheaper hosting bills** ($30,000 → $3,000/month)
- ✅ Faster performance
- ✅ Stable on-prem setup

**Technologies Used:** PostgreSQL, pgsync, Hetzner, Docker, Infrastructure Optimization
