  <p class="lead" style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    You don't need a CTO yet. You need a <strong>product builder</strong>. Someone who can take your Figma designs (or just your idea) and turn them into a fully functional, scalable web application that customers can pay for.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #0366d6;">My "MVP in a Box" Service</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      I specialize in building <strong>Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)</strong> using Ruby on Rails—the same technology used to launch Airbnb, Shopify, and GitHub.

  <h2>What's Included in Your MVP?</h2>
  <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
    
    <div>
      <h3>⚡ Speed to Market</h3>
      <p>I use a battle-tested boilerplate to skip the boring setup (Auth, Emails, Admin) and focus 100% on your unique features.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>💳 Payments Ready</h3>
      <p>Stripe subscription integration (SaaS billing) built-in from day one. Start charging customers immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>📱 Modern UI/UX</h3>
      <p>Clean, responsive interface using TailwindCSS and React/Hotwire. It will look professional and trustworthy.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>🚀 Scalable Foundation</h3>
      <p>Code written by a 10-year veteran. When you get traction, you won't have to rewrite everything.</p>

  <h2>Why Founders Choose Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hiring an agency costs $50k+. Hiring a cheap freelancer leads to spaghetti code.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>100% Job Success Score on Upwork:</strong> I deliver what I promise.</li>
    <li><strong>Business-Minded:</strong> I don't just write code; I ask "does this feature help us launch?"</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> I speak fluent English and provide daily updates. No "black box" development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Let's Validate Your Idea</h2>
  <p>
    Don't spend 6 months building in a cave. Let's build the core features in 4-6 weeks and get it in front of users.
