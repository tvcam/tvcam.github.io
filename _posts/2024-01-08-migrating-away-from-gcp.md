# **How I Helped a Client Save 10x by Migrating from Google Cloud to Hetzner**  

## **Introduction**  
Cloud costs can quickly spiral out of control, especially when infrastructure scaling isnâ€™t optimized. I recently helped a client migrate from Google Cloud to Hetzner in November 2024, reducing their monthly cloud bill from **$30,000 to just $3,000**â€”a massive **90% cost savings**.  

This blog post details why we made the switch, how we executed the migration, and what we learned along the way.

## **Why Move from Google Cloud?**  
My client was running a fairly common stack: **VPS, Redis, and PostgreSQL** on Google Cloud. However, they faced a big problemâ€”every time their system slowed down, instead of diagnosing the root cause, they simply **increased server capacity**.  

Without an experienced DevOps engineer, their infrastructure costs kept rising, and by the time I stepped in, they were spending nearly **$30,000 per month**. It was clear that they needed a better approachâ€”one that wouldnâ€™t break the bank.  

**Why should we be scared of the cloud? Itâ€™s Linux, we use it every day.**

## **Why Hetzner?**  
I first came across Hetzner through a post by [David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH)](https://world.hey.com/dhh), co-founder of 37signals, where he discussed moving away from cloud providers in favor of more cost-effective solutions. Inspired by this, I explored Hetzner and found it to be a great fit for my clientâ€™s needs.  

### **Why Hetzner Was the Right Choice**  
- **Significantly lower pricing** compared to Google Cloud  
- **Powerful dedicated servers** for hosting our own PostgreSQL database  
- **Flexible cloud VPS and storage volumes** for Redis and application servers  
- **Better control over infrastructure** without unnecessary complexity  

With the right setup, we could achieve the same level of performance at a fraction of the cost.

## **The Migration Process**  
Moving from Google Cloud to Hetzner wasnâ€™t just about copying and pasting dataâ€”we had to be strategic.  

### **The Biggest Challenge: PostgreSQL Migration**  
The clientâ€™s PostgreSQL database was massiveâ€”**1.8TB of data**. Migrating it without major downtime was critical. We used **pgsync** to sync data efficiently and minimize service interruptions.  

### **Handling DNS and Downtime**  
- DNS updates were quick, taking only about **2 minutes**.  
- We prioritized database migration over backups due to time constraints, as the next Google Cloud bill was just around the corner.

## **Cost Savings Breakdown**  
Once everything was running smoothly on Hetzner, we were able to **downsize infrastructure significantly**.  

| **Before (Google Cloud)** | **After (Hetzner)** |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| $30,000/month           | $3,000/month       |
| Large VPS & PostgreSQL  | Smaller, optimized VPS & PostgreSQL |
| No infrastructure expert | Efficient, well-planned scaling |

Thatâ€™s a **90% cost reduction** while maintaining stability.

## **Lessons Learned & Who Should Consider This Migration**  
### **Would I Do Anything Differently?**  
Yes, but only to make the process even faster and more efficient. Now that Iâ€™ve done this once, I could **execute it even quicker** for future migrations.  

### **Who Should Consider Moving Away from Google Cloud?**  
If you're:  
âœ… Running multiple **web servers, background workers, Redis, and PostgreSQL**  
âœ… Paying **$1,000+ per month** in cloud costs  
âœ… Open to a **70%+ cost reduction** (even after including migration fees and maintenance)  

Then moving to Hetzner (or another provider) could **save you thousands**â€”and I'd be happy to help make that happen.

## **Final Thoughts**  
Cloud migrations can be intimidating, but with the right approach, they can lead to **huge cost savings without sacrificing performance**. My client is now saving **$27,000 per month** while running a stable, efficient system.
