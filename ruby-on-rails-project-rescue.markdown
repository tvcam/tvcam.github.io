    It's a nightmare scenario: Your app is live, but it's broken. Your developer isn't responding. Or maybe you just fired an agency that left you with a pile of buggy code. <strong>You need a professional to take over immediately.</strong>
  </p>

    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      <li>❌ Critical bugs are affecting customers (and revenue).</li>
      <li>❌ You have no idea how to deploy or restart the server.</li>
      <li>❌ The previous developer left without documentation.</li>
      <li>❌ The codebase is "spaghetti" and hard to change.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>My Rescue Protocol</h2>

        <p>I secure access to your servers (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean) and repo. I run a rapid audit to find the "bleeding" issues.</p>

        <p>I write down <em>how</em> the system works and add automated tests. You will never be held hostage by a developer again.</p>

  <h2>Real Rescue Story: The Missing Source Code</h2>
  <p>
    A client came to me with a running app on Heroku but <strong>zero source code</strong>. The previous developer had deleted the GitHub repo and vanished.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The Fix:</strong> I reverse-engineered the application from the running Heroku "slug" (compiled code), reconstructed the Git repository, updated the dependencies, and redeployed it to a safe account owned by the client.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong> The client regained 100% ownership of their business asset.
